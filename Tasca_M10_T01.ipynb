        "- Check the website's terms of service or robots.txt file: The terms of service or robots.txt file on the website may explicitly prohibit web scraping or provide guidelines for how web scraping can be performed on the site. It's important to read and understand these guidelines before performing any web scraping.\n",

        "- Determine the purpose and scope of the web scraping: If the web scraping is for personal or non-commercial use, it may be more likely to be considered legal and ethical than if it is for commercial or competitive purposes. It's also important to consider the scope of the web scraping, including the frequency and volume of requests and the impact on the website's servers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Obtain permission from the website owner: If in doubt, it's always a good idea to contact the website owner and ask for permission before performing any web scraping. This can help ensure that the web scraping is legal and ethical and can also help establish a positive relationship with the website owner."
